# Hadoop-Cluster-Automation
Python scripts which configure Hadoop both storage and computing cluster automatically according to the user.
Nodes which can be setup by the script are :- Namenode, Datanode, Jobtracker, Tasktracker and the client itself. 
It is a menu driven application which gives choice of nodes to setup in cluster.

Hadoop is written in JAVA and hence require jdk as prerequisite, so jdk (jdk-8u171-linux-x64.rpm) is installed first.
Hadoop version 1 is used for the cluster setup (hadoop-1.2.1-1.x86_64.rpm).

The project is developed in Red hat linux 7.5 so commands of rhel7.5 is used in the project files.
